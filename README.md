# Easy Stats API

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io), created as an example of use of the [loopback-import-mixin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loopback-stats-mixin).

This Project is part of my blog post [How to build Easy Stats with LoopBack](http://mean.expert/2016/04/13/loopback-stats-mixin/).
